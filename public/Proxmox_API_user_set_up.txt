To set up an API user with permissions on Proxmox, follow these steps:
1. Create a User

    Navigate to the Proxmox Web Interface:
        Log in to your Proxmox web interface.

    Access the User Management:
        Go to Datacenter > Permissions > Users.

    Add a New User:
        Click on the Add button.
        In the dialog box, enter the following details:
            User ID: Choose a unique ID for the user (e.g., apiuser).
            Realm: Select PAM if you want the user to authenticate against the local Proxmox user database or PVE for Proxmoxâ€™s internal user database.
            Comment: Optional field for notes.
            Password: Set a secure password for the user.
            Expire: Leave this empty or set a specific expiry date if desired.

2. Assign Permissions

    Determine the Scope:
        Decide on the scope of permissions (e.g., at the Datacenter level, for a specific Node, or a particular VM/CT).

    Assign Permissions:
        Go to Datacenter > Permissions > User Permissions.
        Click on Add.
        In the dialog box, select:
            Path: The scope where the permissions will apply (e.g., / for the entire Datacenter, /vms/<VMID> for a specific VM, etc.).
            User: Select the user you created (e.g., apiuser@pam).
            Role: Choose the appropriate role. Common roles for API users include:
                PVEAdmin: Can manage all aspects of Proxmox except for user management.
                PVEVMAdmin: Can manage VMs and Containers but not the host itself.
                PVEDatastoreAdmin: Can manage storage resources.
                PVEDatastoreUser: Can only read and use storage resources.

3. Generate API Token (Optional)

    Navigate to API Tokens:
        Go to Datacenter > Permissions > API Tokens.
        Select the user (e.g., apiuser@pam) and click on Add.

    Create the Token:
        In the dialog box, provide:
            Token ID: A unique identifier for the token.
            Comment: Optional field for notes.
            Expiration Date: Set an expiration date or leave it blank for no expiration.
            Privilege Separation: Optionally enable privilege separation for security.

    Save the Token:
        Once saved, you'll see the token in the list. Copy the token value as you'll need it for API requests.

4. Testing API Access

    Test the API User:
        Use curl or any API client to make a test request to ensure the user can authenticate and has the correct permissions.

    Example Curl Command:

    bash

curl -k -d 'username=apiuser@pam' --data-urlencode 'password=yourpassword' https://your-proxmox-server:8006/api2/json/access/ticket

    Replace yourpassword with the actual password and your-proxmox-server with the Proxmox host's address.
    If you're using a token:

bash

    curl -k -H "Authorization: PVEAPIToken=apiuser@pam!tokenid=your-token-value" https://your-proxmox-server:8006/api2/json/nodes

5. Configure API Permissions (Optional)

    If you want to fine-tune the API user's access, you can create custom roles under Datacenter > Permissions > Roles and assign them accordingly.
